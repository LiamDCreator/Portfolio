  <p>
    A Cookie's Quest is an endless 2D arcade game developed in Unity and published on the Play Store.
    I designed and built this game as a way to complete a fully realized small-scale project, allowing me to become familiar with every stage of the game development process — from concept to release.
    Publishing the game on the Play Store was not only a way to share my creation with others, but also a meaningful test to see if my work met the standards required for public release.

  <p>
    Slippery Slime is an endless 2D arcade game and my current project. It builds upon the foundations of <em>A Cookie's Quest</em>, but on a larger scale and with increased complexity.
    In this game, you play as a slime caught in the middle of a war between humans and monsters. Both factions actively engage each other on the battlefield, and the player must survive by navigating through the chaos — dodging, weaving, and using the environment to stay alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    The game focuses on two core elements: the player’s unique movement and the dynamic combat between factions.
    By observing enemy patterns and the flow of battle, players can identify safe zones and opportunities to maneuver.
    This encourages strategic thinking and quick reflexes, making each run unpredictable and engaging.

  <h2>My Game Development Journey</h2>

  <p>My interest in game development began when I was 18, after I realized that games weren’t just meant to be played — they could be created. Playing games and learning about them has always been the most fun and inspiring thing for me, so I was surprised it took me that long to realize I could start making them myself.</p>

  <p>I immediately started experimenting and enrolled in the Hogeschool van Amsterdam to study game development. While I did learn the basics, I had little time for personal projects, and after 1.5 years I realized the academic route wasn’t the right fit for me. I made the decision to leave and fully focus on learning game development on my own.</p>

  <p>Along the way, I ran into common beginner pitfalls — getting stuck in tutorial hell, or trying to build games that were way too large for my skill level. Even though these struggles slowed me down at times, they taught me valuable lessons about what it actually takes to complete a game. Most importantly, they showed me how passionate I am about game development — because even after failing over and over, I still wanted to keep going.</p>

  <p>To break the cycle and improve my approach, I decided to create a complete game with the smallest possible scope. That became <em>A Cookie’s Quest</em>, a simple but finished project that helped me understand the full development pipeline from start to finish. I'm currently working on <em>Slippery Slime</em>, a more ambitious project with a higher level of complexity, and I’m excited to keep building from here.</p>

  <h3>Game Development Studies</h3> 
  <p><i>2022 – 2024 (1.5 years)</i></p> 

  <p>During my time at HvA, I studied the fundamentals of game development, including programming, design, and project workflows.  
  My most valuable experiences came from collaborating in team-based projects, where I learned how to communicate effectively, divide responsibilities, and contribute to larger creative goals.</p>
